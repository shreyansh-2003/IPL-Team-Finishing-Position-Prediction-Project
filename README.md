# DESCRIPTION
This is a capstone level classification ML project for predicting IPL team finishing position for an year based on Individual player's performance. The project includes web-scraping ESPN cricinfo website for ipl player statistics, pre-processing the data, and comparing different classification models and hyperparameter tuning them.

# CLASSIFICATION MODELS BEING COMPARED

__*__ Models to be created include __KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree , Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes__

> # Classification Capstone Project Tasks
- Identifying a domain with a problem which can be addressed using Prediction Techniques.
- Creating a Dataset for classification with minimum 20 Features and 100 rows. The Data is scrapped from espn cricinfo's website.
- Ensure the dataset has all possible combination of feature where data preprocessing techniques can be applied ( Data Cleaning, Dimensionality Reduction, Data Transformation, Feature Engineering).
- Applying all the categories of classification algorithm( KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes) along with hyper parameter tuning and measure through best suited evaluation metric.
- Using the ROC curve to determine the best algorithm for your dataset.

# DATA COLLECTION (WEBSCRAPING) 

__URL Adjustments being made for Web-Scrapping (scrape_espn_cricinfo.py)__<br>

#### Sample ESPN CRICINFO URL
**Year: 2008<br> Team: Royal Challengers Bangalore**<br>
- Batting: https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=3519;team=4340;type=tournament
- Bowling:https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=3519;team=4340;type=tournament

### Note: Exceptions
These following teams are either new entrants, defunct, or were suspended in between seasons, so upon trying to webscrape the following, we will be thrown an error or will receive an empty dataset.<br>
1. **Decan Chargers**
2. **Pune Warriors India** 
3. **Kochi Tuskers Kerala**
4. **Gujarat Lions**
5. **Rising Pune Supergiants**
6. **Lucknow Super Giants**
7. **Gujarat Titans**
8. **Chennai Super Kings**
9. **Rajasthan Royals**

To handle this abnormality, we created nested dictionaries in the ```scrape_espn_cricinfo.py``` webscrapping file that hold the team's id assigned in the ESPN Cricinfo database and the years they have participated in the IPL in. These years will then be iterated through to avoid discrepencies
